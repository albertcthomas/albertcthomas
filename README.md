## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a research engineer in machine learning at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. 

Working on projects that are not open source, I have not been very active on GitHub in the recent years besides opening issues to report issues or ask for help.
However, here's a selection of my previous open source contributions.
- [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn), see my [scikit-learn PRs](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aalbertcthomas) including
  * SGD implementation of the One-Class SVM, [PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/10027)
  * Common tests for outlier detectors, [PR](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/10027)
- [rl_simulator](https://github.com/ramp-kits/rl_simulator), a model-based reinforcement learning library for our ICLR 2021 paper.
- [ramp-workflow](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow), see my [PRs](https://github.com/albertcthomas/anomaly_tuning)
- [anomaly_tuning](https://github.com/albertcthomas/anomaly_tuning), learning hyperparameters for unsupervised anomaly detection.
